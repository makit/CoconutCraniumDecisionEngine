    This can contain as many urls as needed, it will always use the last url in the list that isn't commented out.
    A comment is when the line begins with a @ sign.
  <url>
#   url is http://localhost:49179/Default.aspx<!--end url-->
#   url is http://testing/Default.aspx<!--end url-->
    url is http://coconut.azurewebsites.net/<!--end url-->
